# Application Development II Semester Project
## DUCS Time Tracker (DTT)
## Spring Semester 2021

## Preface
This repo is derived from the previous repo owned by my professor, Dr. Sigman. I wanted to make a new repo with my code copied over that is separate from him and my university. This is my project and my code that spanned over 7 sprints and 3 months. I just wanted a fresh repo that is owned and managed by only me.

## Overview

The *DUCS Time Tracker (DTT)* project is a web/mobile app that supports Drury Math & Computer Science courses that require students to record the time they spend on a course project.  The application will allow student to easilty record the time they spend working on projects in their classes.  It will also allow instructors to easily 
create weekly time sheets for use in recording grades.  The functionality of the app is defined in the following set of user stories.

## Requirements

In software development we define the requirements for a software product in terms of stories about how the users will use the system, which are referred to as user stories. The complete list of user stories for a product is known as the backlog. The backlog for the *DTT* system follows:

*Note:* Each user story start with a name for the story in *italics* followed by a colon.  The actor of the story will appear in ***bold italics***.  The first underlined clause indicates what the user wants to do with the product (the functionality).  The second underlined clause indicates reason the actor wants the indicated functionality.

*Record Work Session:* As a ***student*** I want to <span style="text-decoration: underline">record the time I worked on the project on a work session by session basis </span> so that <span style="text-decoration: underline">I have the freedom to record my daily work on a project at multiple times during a day</span>.

*Authenticate User:* As an ***instructor*** I want <span style="text-decoration: underline">students to have to authenticate themselves before recording a worksession</span> so that <span style="text-decoration: underline">I can comply with the law regarding the privacy of student grades</span>.

*View Weekly Time Card:* As a ***student*** <span style="text-decoration: underline">I want to be able to view my weekly time card</span> so that <span style="text-decoration: underline">I can review the project work time I have recorded</span>.

*Search Time Cards:* As a ***student*** I want to be able to <span style="text-decoration: underline">search my submitted time cards by week</span>
so that <span style="text-decoration: underline">I can review how I recorded an activity on a previous card</span>.

*Explore Time Cards:* As an ***instructor*** I want to be able to  <span style="text-decoration: underline">search all time cards for a project by
week</span> so that  <span style="text-decoration: underline">I can review the cards submitted by students for that week</span>.

*Assign Teams:* As an ***instructor*** I want to be able to  <span style="text-decoration: underline">assign students to a team</span> so that  <span style="text-decoration: underline">I can
manage the time a team works on a project</span>.

*Review Team Reports:* As an ***instructor*** I want to be able to <span style="text-decoration: underline">view student time cards by team</span> so
that <span style="text-decoration: underline">I can analyze a teamâ€™s work on a project</span>.

## Sprint 3

### Objective

The objective of sprint 3 is to allow an instructor to easily record grades for a project.

### User Story

*View Class Report:* As a ***instructor*** I want to be able to <span style="text-decoration: underline">view a report of time cards for a project</span> so that <span style="text-decoration: underline">I can record time worked on the project in my grade book</span>.


### UI Notes

The main page that an instructor lands on will be the project reporting page.  This page will allow an instructor to choose a project and the starting date of reporting week.  The starting date will default to the Sunday of the current week.  The report generated from this information will show the project name the starting date and ending date of the report and one line for each student working on the project. Each student line will have the student's name and the total hours they recorded on their time card for the week.  Clicking on a student line will bring up a detailed time card for the student in a modal popup.

### Example Time Sheet

```
Name: Jane Doe	             Week: 7/24/2020 to 7/30/2020
Project: Drury Arbor Map	 Total Hours Worked: 2.5

Date	Start	            Finish	   Time	   Code	   Activity

### Objective

The objective of Sprint 4 is to implement a token based login process and to ensure that only encrypted passwords are stored in the database.
